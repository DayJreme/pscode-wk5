
// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

Enter the first number: 09
Enter the second number: 86
The sum of 9 and 86 is: 95


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Enter a number: 7
The number 7 is odd.

Enter a number: 8
The number 8 is even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

PRINT "Enter 5 numbers:"
    READ number1
    READ number2
    READ number3
    READ number4
    READ number5


Step b: Calculate the average of the five numbers
    SET sum = number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5
    SET average = sum / 5



SET min = number1
    SET max = number1

    IF number2 < min THEN
        SET min = number2
    ENDIF
    IF number3 < min THEN
        SET min = number3
    ENDIF
    IF number4 < min THEN
        SET min = number4
    ENDIF
    IF number5 < min THEN
        SET min = number5
    ENDIF

    IF number2 > max THEN
        SET max = number2
    ENDIF
    IF number3 > max THEN
        SET max = number3
    ENDIF
    IF number4 > max THEN
        SET max = number4
    ENDIF
    IF number5 > max THEN
        SET max = number5
    ENDIF





PRINT "The average of the entered numbers is:", average
    PRINT "The smallest number is:", min
    PRINT "The largest number is:", max
